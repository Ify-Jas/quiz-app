This is a coding quiz challenge using Javascript.

This week's challenge was to create a quiz app using Javascript. This allowed me to use all that we have learnt so far in Javascript including setting up functions, loop and a bit of jQuery. 

I found this particular assignment quite challenging as I had more than a few bugs which needed ironing out. No doubt will get better with experience. I was able to display all the questions I already set in a different JS file. I was able to incorporate the sound to play when the answer is either right or wrong and this works just fine.


I look forward to coming back to this work to optimise it.
